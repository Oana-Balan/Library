# Library
This application is a web app which is used to process the orders from an online library.
There are 2 types of users: an administrator who manages the library and a number of clients who can borrow books, if they are available. 
They must log into their own accounts and perform the operations available there. The administrator has the possibility to put 
books in stock and delete them if they are no longer available, to check the stock and status of the borrowed books, as well as to create 
the client's account and to edit or delete it. The client has the possibility to enter his/her ID and the ID of the book and to borrow it. 
If the book cannot be borrowed, a message specifying a message informing the customer that the book cannot be borrowed is no longer 
possible.
The way to use it is the following: if a customer wants to enter a new order he has to fill in a form, specifying the id of the desired 
book and his/her id.
If the administrator wants to add a new book to the stock it is required to complete the product fields: id, name, author, publisher and 
quantity; these being the characteristics of the product. To create a client's account, the administrator will fill in a form with the 
client's data, namely: id, name, password, email and telephone.
If the administrator or client fails the login data, they can try again, a new login form will appear.
